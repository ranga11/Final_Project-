# 1.	Open: The price at the beginning of the trading day
# 2.	High: The highest price the stock reached during the day
# 3.	Low: The lowest price the stock reached during the day
# 4.	Close: The final closing price of the stock for the day which becomes the opening price for the next day.
# 5.	Volume: Volume is the number of shares that have been traded that is sold or brought throughout the day.It is important to understand Volume: A stock with low volume is thinly traded as it lacks liquidity, i.e., it would be difficult to buy or sell the stocks of that company easily.Similarly, if there is a stock that has a volume higher or more than the average trade-off dealing in this case can be volatile as the price fluctuation would be drastic and quick.  
# 6.	Adjust Closing Price: An adjusted closing price is a stock’s closing price on a given day of trading that has been amended to include any distribution and corporate actions that occur before the next day opening. The adjusted closing price is a useful tool when examining historical returns because it gives analyst an accurate representation of the firm’s equity value beyond the simple market price.It includes the corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends/distribution, and right offerings.
